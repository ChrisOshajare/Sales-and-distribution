 Trying to find the relationship between the customer contacted minimum of 10 times through direct channel and their total spending.
 This is achieve by: 
 Using the events table to find information regarding companies (accounts) that were contacted minimum of 10 times via direct channel 
 at any time in 2016 and then which of these accounts are the top 20 spending.
 
 SELECT acc.name, web.channel, COUNT (web.channel) AS no_time_contacted, 
 		SUM (ord.total_amt_usd) AS total_sum_spent
 FROM web_events web
 JOIN accounts acc
 ON web.account_id = acc.id
 JOIN orders AS ord
 ON acc.id = ord.account_id
 WHERE web.channel = 'direct' AND CAST(web.occurred_at AS varchar) like '%2016%'
 GROUP BY 1,2
 ORDER BY 4 DESC
 LIMIT 20;

 I need the categorization of customers based on their total amount of purchases. The categorisation should:
 Top level when total sales of all orders is greater than $200,000;
 Middle level includes customers (accounts) with sales between $200,000 and $100,000 and
 Lowest level is accounts under $100,000 sales orders.
 I provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer,
 and the level. Top spending customers are listed first.
 
 
SELECT acc.name,  SUM (ord.total) AS qty_ordered, SUM (ord.total_amt_usd) AS total_sales,
	  CASE WHEN SUM(ord.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'Top Level'
	  WHEN SUM(ord.total_amt_usd) BETWEEN 100000 and 200000 THEN 'Middle Level'
	  ELSE 'Lowest Level' END AS customer_level
FROM accounts AS acc
JOIN orders AS ord
ON acc.id = ord.account_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

I explore the database to determine the top performing sales representatives and their regions based on the number of orders 
they generated. Top performers are those with minimum of 100000 orders generated while others are not top performers.

SELECT sale.name, rg.name AS region_name, SUM (ord.total) AS ordered_qty,
	   CASE WHEN SUM (ord.total) >= 100000 THEN 'Top Performer'
	   ELSE 'Not' END AS sales_reps_performance
FROM orders AS ord
JOIN accounts AS acc
ON ord.account_id = acc.id
JOIN sales_reps AS sale
ON acc.sales_rep_id = sale.id
JOIN region AS rg
ON sale.region_id = rg.id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


EXPLORATION 4

The sales reps above only factored in the order quantity, some representatives might have less order counts but higher sales volume.
Therefore, the following stratification is used to assess reps performance:
Those with minimum of 100000 order quantity and more than 10000000 in total sales as top performers;
Those between 50000 and 100000 orders and between 5000000 and 10000000 in sales as middle;
others are low performers.

SELECT sale.name, rg.name AS region_name, SUM (ord.total) AS ordered_qty, SUM (ord.total_amt_usd) AS total_sales,
	   CASE WHEN SUM (ord.total) >= 100000 OR SUM (ord.total_amt_usd) >= 1000000 THEN 'Top Performer'
	   WHEN SUM (ord.total) BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000
	   OR SUM (ord.total_amt_usd) >= 500000 AND SUM (ord.total_amt_usd) < 1000000 THEN 'Middle Performer'
	   ELSE 'Not' END AS sales_reps_performance
FROM orders AS ord
JOIN accounts AS acc
ON ord.account_id = acc.id
JOIN sales_reps AS sale
ON acc.sales_rep_id = sale.id
JOIN region AS rg
ON sale.region_id = rg.id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 4 DESC;


EXPLORATION 5

This drills down on the best performing customer based on total amount spent,
showing the number of events the customer have by each channel?

SELECT COUNT (web.channel) AS no_of_events, acc.name, web.channel
FROM web_events AS web
JOIN accounts AS acc
ON web.account_id = acc.id
WHERE acc.name = (SELECT name
				  FROM				  
				  (SELECT SUM (ord.total_amt_usd),acc.name 
				  from orders AS ord
				  JOIN accounts AS acc
				  ON ord.account_id = acc.id 
				  GROUP BY 2
                  ORDER BY 1 desc 
				  LIMIT 1) AS sub1)
GROUP BY 2, 3
ORDER BY 1 desc;
